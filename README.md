Programm will stream live tweets and covert them into a dataframe

I'm trying to convert the incoming tweets into a data frame. I'm having trouble feeding the incoming data into the data frame function. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I'm fairly new to coding so apologies for my lack of proficiency.
